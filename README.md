## About the Project
This project meets on Monday at the westside hacknight. We are working with a program of the City of LA's Attorney's Office which supports the Criminal Record Clearing Project by administering the Los Angeles County Homeless Court Program. HEART (Homeless Engagement and Response Team) deploys its staff to homeless connect days in the community where adults who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of experiencing homelessness may enroll in the program. The program helps participants resolve eligible traffic and pedestrian infraction citations by engaging in services instead of paying fines and fees they cannot afford. HEART files a motion with the Los Angeles Superior Court, requesting a dismissal and/or suspension of fines, and a recall of associated warrants.

Hack for LA has been working with the program's staff to design and build a better processing system, helping to streamline in-person client intake, data processing and the filing of motions. 

Find us on the Hack for LA Slack on the channel #heart, or join us at one of our meetings, every Monday night in Santa Monica.
